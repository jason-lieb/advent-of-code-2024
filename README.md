# Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code challenges completed with Go and built with Nix

## Use

- To install dev tools, run `nix develop`
- To build the packages (and run tests), run `nix build`
- After building to run the executables, run `./result/bin/...`
- To run tests directly, go into the project directory and run `go test`
